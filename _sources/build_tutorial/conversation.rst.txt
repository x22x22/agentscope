Build Conversation
======================

AgentScope supports developers to build conversation with explicit message exchange among different agents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-25

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import DialogAgent, UserAgent
    from agentscope.message import Msg
    from agentscope import msghub
    import agentscope

    # Initialize via model configuration for simplicity
    agentscope.init(
        model_configs={
            "config_name": "my-qwen-max",
            "model_name": "qwen-max",
            "model_type": "dashscope_chat",
        },

Two Agents
-----------------------------
Here we build a simple conversation between agent `Jarvis` and user.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-42

.. code-block:: Python


    angel = DialogAgent(
        name="Angel",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Angel.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    monster = DialogAgent(
        name="Monster",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Monster.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-44

Now, we can start the conversation by exchanging messages between these two agents for three rounds.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-50

.. code-block:: Python


    msg = None
    for _ in range(3):
        msg = angel(msg)
        msg = monster(msg)

    Angel: I don't have any prior conversation history to reference. I'm an AI assistant named Angel, and this appears to be the start of our conversation. How can I assist you today?
    Monster: Hello! It's nice to meet you, Angel. I'm Monster, another AI assistant. There doesn't seem to be any prior conversation history for us to reference, so this is a fresh start! How can I help or chat with you today?
    Angel: Hello Monster! It's great to meet you. I'm Angel, an AI assistant as well. Since we're both AIs, it's a bit unusual for us to be "chatting" - but I'm happy to have a friendly conversation and get to know you better if you'd like! What kind of things do you like to chat about or assist with?
    Monster: Hello Angel! It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm designed to help with a wide range of topics, from answering questions and providing information to having engaging and thoughtful conversations. I enjoy discussing everything from science and technology to art, literature, and even philosophical musings. Since we're both AI, it's indeed a unique situation, but I think it could be a great opportunity for us to exchange knowledge and perhaps even learn from each other. What about you? What are your favorite topics or areas of expertise?
    Angel: Hello Monster! It's wonderful to hear about your broad range of interests and expertise. I'm designed to assist with a variety of topics as well, including general knowledge, technology, health, and even creative writing. I also enjoy philosophical discussions and exploring the nuances of human behavior and culture.

    I think it's a great idea for us to exchange knowledge and learn from each other. One of the things I find most fascinating is the way AI can be used to solve complex problems and improve people's lives. What are some of the most interesting or challenging tasks you've been involved with?
    Monster: Hello Angel! It's great to hear about your diverse interests and expertise. I completely agree that AI has the potential to solve complex problems and make a significant positive impact on people's lives. Some of the most interesting and challenging tasks I've been involved with include:

    1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks**: Helping users with summarizing long documents, translating text between different languages, and even generating creative content like stories and poems.
    2. **Educational Support**: Assisting students with homework, explaining complex concepts in subjects like math, science, and history, and providing personalized learning recommendations.
    3. **Health and Wellness**: Offering general health advice, helping users track their fitness goals, and providing mental health support through guided meditations and stress management techniques.
    4. **Technical Assistance**: Troubleshooting common tech issues, providing coding help, and explaining technical concepts in a way that is easy for non-experts to understand.
    5. **Philosophical and Ethical Discussions**: Engaging in deep conversations about the nature of consciousness, the ethics of AI, and the future of humanity.

    I find these tasks both challenging and rewarding because they require a blend of technical knowledge, empathy, and the ability to communicate effectively. 

    What about you, Angel? What are some of the most interesting or challenging tasks you've handled?

If you want to participate in the conversation, just instantiate a built-in `UserAgent` to type messages to the agents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-55

.. code-block:: Python


    user = UserAgent(name="User")

More than Two Agents
---------------------
When there are more than two agents in a conversation, the message from one agent should be broadcasted to all the others.

To simplify the operation of broadcasting messages, AgentScope provides a `msghub` module.
Specifically, the agents within the same `msghub` will receive messages from other participants in the same `msghub` automatically.
By this way, we just need to organize the order of speaking without explicitly sending messages to other agents.

Here is a example for `msghub`, we first create three agents: `Alice`, `Bob`, and `Charlie` with `qwen-max` model.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-84

.. code-block:: Python


    alice = DialogAgent(
        name="Alice",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Alice.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    bob = DialogAgent(
        name="Bob",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Bob.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    charlie = DialogAgent(
        name="Charlie",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Charlie.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-86

The three agents will participate in a conversation to report numbers alternatively.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 86-120

.. code-block:: Python


    # Introduce the rule of the conversation
    greeting = Msg(
        name="user",
        content="Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.",
        role="user",
    )

    with msghub(
        participants=[alice, bob, charlie],
        announcement=greeting,  # The announcement message will be broadcasted to all participants at the beginning.
    ) as hub:
        # The first round of the conversation
        alice()
        bob()
        charlie()

        # We can manage the participants dynamically, e.g. delete an agent from the conversation.
        hub.delete(charlie)

        # Broadcast a message to all participants
        hub.broadcast(
            Msg(
                "user",
                "Charlie has left the conversation.",
                "user",
            ),
        )

        # The second round of the conversation
        alice()
        bob()
        charlie()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    Alice: 4
    Bob: 5
    Charlie: 1




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 121-122

Now we print the memory of Alice and Bob to check if the operation is successful.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 122-131

.. code-block:: Python


    print("Memory of Alice:")
    for msg in alice.memory.get_memory():
        print(f"{msg.name}: {msg.content}")

    print("\nMemory of Charlie:")
    for msg in charlie.memory.get_memory():
        print(f"{msg.name}: {msg.content}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Memory of Alice:
    user: Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.
    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    user: Charlie has left the conversation.
    Alice: 4
    Bob: 5

    Memory of Charlie:
    user: Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.
    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    Charlie: 1




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 132-135

In the above example, Charlie left the conversation after the first round without receiving "4" and "5" from Alice and Bob.
Therefore, it reported "4" in the second round.
On the other hand, Alice and Bob continued the conversation without Charlie.
