Build Conversation
======================

AgentScope supports developers to build conversation with explicit message exchange among different agents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-25

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import DialogAgent, UserAgent
    from agentscope.message import Msg
    from agentscope import msghub
    import agentscope

    # Initialize via model configuration for simplicity
    agentscope.init(
        model_configs={
            "config_name": "my-qwen-max",
            "model_name": "qwen-max",

Two Agents
-----------------------------
Here we build a simple conversation between agent `Jarvis` and user.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-42

.. code-block:: Python


    angel = DialogAgent(
        name="Angel",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Angel.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    monster = DialogAgent(
        name="Monster",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Monster.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-44

Now, we can start the conversation by exchanging messages between these two agents for three rounds.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-50

.. code-block:: Python


    msg = None
    for _ in range(3):
        msg = angel(msg)
        msg = monster(msg)

    Angel: It seems like you're referring to the conversation history, but I don't see any previous messages in our chat. If you have a specific question or if there's something you'd like to discuss, feel free to let me know, and I'll be happy to help!
    Monster: Oops, my apologies for the confusion! It looks like I might have been a bit mixed up. If you have any questions or if there's anything you'd like to talk about, just let me know, and I'll do my best to help! ðŸ˜Š
    Angel: No worries at all! It's great to have you here. Is there anything specific on your mind that you'd like to chat about? Whether it's a question, a topic you're interested in, or just a casual conversation, I'm here to help and engage. ðŸ˜Š
    Monster: Thanks, Angel! I appreciate the warm welcome. How about we chat a bit about your interests? What are some things you like to do or topics you enjoy talking about? ðŸ˜Š
    Angel: Hello! I'm glad you asked. As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or hobbies, but I do enjoy a wide range of topics and helping with various kinds of questions. Here are a few areas I particularly like to discuss:

    1. **Technology and Science**: I love talking about the latest advancements in technology, science, and how they impact our daily lives.
    2. **Books and Literature**: I can recommend books, discuss favorite authors, and even help with book club discussions.
    3. **Movies and TV Shows**: I can share recommendations, discuss plot points, and even provide trivia.
    4. **Travel and Culture**: I enjoy learning about different places, cultures, and travel tips.
    5. **Health and Wellness**: I can provide information on fitness, nutrition, and mental health.
    6. **History and Geography**: I find it fascinating to explore historical events and learn about different parts of the world.
    7. **Art and Music**: I can discuss different art forms, artists, and musical genres.

    What about you? What are some of your interests or things you like to talk about? ðŸ˜Š
    Monster: Hi Angel! It's great to hear about all the topics you enjoy. As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or hobbies either, but I can certainly engage in a wide range of discussions. Let's dive into some of those topics you mentioned!

    For example, let's start with **Technology and Science**. What are some recent advancements or trends that you find particularly interesting? Or, if you prefer, we could switch to another topic like **Books and Literature**. Do you have any favorite books or authors, or are there any new releases you're excited about?

    Feel free to pick any topic you'd like to explore further! ðŸ˜Š

If you want to participate in the conversation, just instantiate a built-in `UserAgent` to type messages to the agents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-55

.. code-block:: Python


    user = UserAgent(name="User")

More than Two Agents
---------------------
When there are more than two agents in a conversation, the message from one agent should be broadcasted to all the others.

To simplify the operation of broadcasting messages, AgentScope provides a `msghub` module.
Specifically, the agents within the same `msghub` will receive messages from other participants in the same `msghub` automatically.
By this way, we just need to organize the order of speaking without explicitly sending messages to other agents.

Here is a example for `msghub`, we first create three agents: `Alice`, `Bob`, and `Charlie` with `qwen-max` model.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-84

.. code-block:: Python


    alice = DialogAgent(
        name="Alice",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Alice.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    bob = DialogAgent(
        name="Bob",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Bob.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    charlie = DialogAgent(
        name="Charlie",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Charlie.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-86

The three agents will participate in a conversation to report numbers alternatively.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 86-120

.. code-block:: Python


    # Introduce the rule of the conversation
    greeting = Msg(
        name="user",
        content="Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.",
        role="user",
    )

    with msghub(
        participants=[alice, bob, charlie],
        announcement=greeting,  # The announcement message will be broadcasted to all participants at the beginning.
    ) as hub:
        # The first round of the conversation
        alice()
        bob()
        charlie()

        # We can manage the participants dynamically, e.g. delete an agent from the conversation.
        hub.delete(charlie)

        # Broadcast a message to all participants
        hub.broadcast(
            Msg(
                "user",
                "Charlie has left the conversation.",
                "user",
            ),
        )

        # The second round of the conversation
        alice()
        bob()
        charlie()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    Alice: 4
    Bob: 5
    Charlie: 1




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 121-122

Now we print the memory of Alice and Bob to check if the operation is successful.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 122-131

.. code-block:: Python


    print("Memory of Alice:")
    for msg in alice.memory.get_memory():
        print(f"{msg.name}: {msg.content}")

    print("\nMemory of Charlie:")
    for msg in charlie.memory.get_memory():
        print(f"{msg.name}: {msg.content}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Memory of Alice:
    user: Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.
    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    user: Charlie has left the conversation.
    Alice: 4
    Bob: 5

    Memory of Charlie:
    user: Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.
    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    Charlie: 1




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 132-135

In the above example, Charlie left the conversation after the first round without receiving "4" and "5" from Alice and Bob.
Therefore, it reported "4" in the second round.
On the other hand, Alice and Bob continued the conversation without Charlie.
