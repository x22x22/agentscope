Build Conversation
======================

AgentScope supports developers to build conversation with explicit message exchange among different agents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-25

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import DialogAgent, UserAgent
    from agentscope.message import Msg
    from agentscope import msghub
    import agentscope

    # Initialize via model configuration for simplicity
    agentscope.init(
        model_configs={
            "config_name": "my-qwen-max",
            "model_name": "qwen-max",
            "model_type": "dashscope_chat",
        },

Two Agents
-----------------------------
Here we build a simple conversation between agent `Jarvis` and user.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-42

.. code-block:: Python


    angel = DialogAgent(
        name="Angel",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Angel.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    monster = DialogAgent(
        name="Monster",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Monster.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-44

Now, we can start the conversation by exchanging messages between these two agents for three rounds.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-50

.. code-block:: Python


    msg = None
    for _ in range(3):
        msg = angel(msg)
        msg = monster(msg)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Angel: It looks like the conversation history is empty. How can I assist you today?
    Monster: Hello! I'm Monster, your helpful assistant. It seems like we're starting fresh here. How can I assist you today? Whether you have questions, need help with a task, or just want to chat, I'm here for you!
    Angel: Hello! I'm Angel, your helpful assistant. It seems like there might be a bit of confusion with the names, but no worries! How can I assist you today? Whether you have questions, need help with a task, or just want to chat, I'm here for you!
    Monster: Hello! I'm Monster, your helpful assistant. It looks like there was a bit of a mix-up with the names, but no worries! How can I assist you today? Whether you have questions, need help with a task, or just want to chat, I'm here for you! ðŸ˜Š
    Angel: Hello! I'm Angel, your helpful assistant. It seems like there's a bit of a mix-up with the names, but no worries at all! How can I assist you today? Whether you have questions, need help with a task, or just want to chat, I'm here for you! ðŸ˜Š
    Monster: Hello! I'm Monster, your helpful assistant. It looks like we've had a bit of a back-and-forth with the names, but that's okay! How can I assist you today? Whether you have questions, need help with a task, or just want to chat, I'm here for you! ðŸ˜Š

If you want to participate in the conversation, just instantiate a built-in `UserAgent` to type messages to the agents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-55

.. code-block:: Python


    user = UserAgent(name="User")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-65

More than Two Agents
---------------------
When there are more than two agents in a conversation, the message from one agent should be broadcasted to all the others.

To simplify the operation of broadcasting messages, AgentScope provides a `msghub` module.
Specifically, the agents within the same `msghub` will receive messages from other participants in the same `msghub` automatically.
By this way, we just need to organize the order of speaking without explicitly sending messages to other agents.

Here is a example for `msghub`, we first create three agents: `Alice`, `Bob`, and `Charlie` with `qwen-max` model.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-84

.. code-block:: Python


    alice = DialogAgent(
        name="Alice",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Alice.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    bob = DialogAgent(
        name="Bob",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Bob.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    charlie = DialogAgent(
        name="Charlie",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Charlie.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-86

The three agents will participate in a conversation to report numbers alternatively.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 86-120

.. code-block:: Python


    # Introduce the rule of the conversation
    greeting = Msg(
        name="user",
        content="Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.",
        role="user",
    )

    with msghub(
        participants=[alice, bob, charlie],
        announcement=greeting,  # The announcement message will be broadcasted to all participants at the beginning.
    ) as hub:
        # The first round of the conversation
        alice()
        bob()
        charlie()

        # We can manage the participants dynamically, e.g. delete an agent from the conversation.
        hub.delete(charlie)

        # Broadcast a message to all participants
        hub.broadcast(
            Msg(
                "user",
                "Charlie has left the conversation.",
                "user",
            ),
        )

        # The second round of the conversation
        alice()
        bob()
        charlie()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    Alice: 4
    Bob: 5
    Charlie: 4




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 121-122

Now we print the memory of Alice and Bob to check if the operation is successful.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 122-131

.. code-block:: Python


    print("Memory of Alice:")
    for msg in alice.memory.get_memory():
        print(f"{msg.name}: {msg.content}")

    print("\nMemory of Charlie:")
    for msg in charlie.memory.get_memory():
        print(f"{msg.name}: {msg.content}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Memory of Alice:
    user: Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.
    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    user: Charlie has left the conversation.
    Alice: 4
    Bob: 5

    Memory of Charlie:
    user: Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.
    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    Charlie: 4




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 132-135

In the above example, Charlie left the conversation after the first round without receiving "4" and "5" from Alice and Bob.
Therefore, it reported "4" in the second round.
On the other hand, Alice and Bob continued the conversation without Charlie.
