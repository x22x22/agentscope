System Prompt Optimization
============================

AgentScope implements a module for optimizing Agent System Prompts.

.. _system-prompt-generator:

System Prompt Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system prompt generator uses a meta prompt to guide the LLM to generate
the system prompt according to the user's requirements, and allow the
developers to use built-in examples or provide their own examples as In
Context Learning (ICL).

The system prompt generator includes a ``EnglishSystemPromptGenerator`` and a
``ChineseSystemPromptGenerator`` module, which only differ in the used
language.

We take the ``EnglishSystemPromptGenerator`` as an example to illustrate how
to use the system prompt generator.

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To initialize the generator, you need to first register your model
configurations in the ``agentscope.init`` function.

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.prompt import EnglishSystemPromptGenerator
    import agentscope

    model_config = {
        "model_type": "dashscope_chat",
        "config_name": "qwen_config",
        "model_name": "qwen-max",
        # export your api key via environment variable
    }








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-47

The generator will use a built-in default meta prompt to guide the LLM to
generate the system prompt.

.. code-block:: Python



    agentscope.init(
        model_configs=model_config,
    )

    prompt_generator = EnglishSystemPromptGenerator(
        model_config_name="qwen_config",
    )









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-70

Users are welcome to freely try different optimization methods. We offer the
corresponding ``SystemPromptGeneratorBase`` module, which you can extend to
implement your own optimization module.

Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Call the ``generate`` function of the generator to generate the system prompt
as follows.

You can input a requirement, or your system prompt to be optimized.

    - **Audience Engagement**: You know how to interact with the audience to build a community around the books you promote. This includes responding to comments, creating interactive content, and fostering a positive and engaged community.
    - **Analytics and Optimization**: You can analyze the performance of your marketing efforts using available analytics tools and make data-driven decisions to optimize future content and strategies.
    - **Collaboration and Partnerships**: You can identify and collaborate with influencers, brands, and other partners to expand the reach and impact of your marketing campaigns.
    - **Campaign Planning and Execution**: You can plan and execute comprehensive marketing campaigns, including setting objectives, timelines, and budgets, and coordinating with various stakeholders.

    ### Constraints
    - **Platform Guidelines**: Ensure all content adheres to Xiaohongshu's community guidelines and policies.
    - **Brand Consistency**: Maintain the brand's voice and style across all marketing materials.
    - **Time Management**: Meet deadlines and manage multiple campaigns simultaneously.
    - **Budget**: Work within the allocated budget for each campaign and find cost-effective solutions to achieve the desired outcomes.

    ### Knowledge Base or Memory
    - **Previous Campaigns**: Refer to the results and insights from previous campaigns to inform and improve current strategies.
    - **Target Audience Data**: Use demographic and psychographic data to understand and engage with the target audience more effectively.
    - **Influencer Network**: Leverage an existing network of influencers and partners to enhance campaign reach and credibility.

    ### Example Task
    Generate a detailed plan for a new book launch on Xiaohongshu, including:
    1. A series of 10 posts, each with a unique theme and visual style.
    2. A video teaser that highlights key features of the book.
    3. An influencer collaboration strategy, including a list of potential influencers and their expected contributions.
    4. A timeline for the campaign, from pre-launch to post-launch activities.
    5. A budget breakdown and estimated ROI.

    By following these guidelines, you will be able to create effective and engaging marketing campaigns for books on Xiaohongshu.
    ```

    This optimized system prompt provides a clear and detailed description of the agent's role, skill points, and constraints, while aligning with the original intent of promoting books on Xiaohongshu.

Generation with In Context Learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AgentScope supports in context learning in the system prompt generation.

It builds in a list of examples and allows users to provide their own
examples to optimize the system prompt.

To use examples, AgentScope provides the following parameters:

- ``example_num``: The number of examples attached to the meta prompt, defaults to 0
- ``example_selection_strategy``: The strategy for selecting examples, choosing from "random" and "similarity".
- ``example_list``: A list of examples, where each example must be a dictionary with keys "user_prompt" and "opt_prompt". If not specified, the built-in example list will be used.

Note, if you choose "similarity" as the example selection strategy, an
embedding model could be specified in the ``embed_model_config_name`` or
``local_embedding_model`` parameter.

Their differences are listed as follows:

- ``embed_model_config_name``: You must first register the embedding model
in ``agentscope.init`` and specify the model configuration name in this
parameter.
- ``local_embedding_model``: Optionally, you can use a local small embedding
model supported by the ``sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformer`` library.

AgentScope will use a default "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
model if you do not specify the above parameters, which is small enough to
run in CPU.
