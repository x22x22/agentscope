Built-in Agents
=============================

AgentScope builds in several agent class to support different scenarios and
show how to build agents with AgentScope.

DialogAgent
----------------------------
The dialog agent is the most basic agent in AgentScope, which can interact
with users in a dialog manner.
Developers can customize it by providing different system prompts and model
configurations.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-72

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import DialogAgent
    from agentscope.message import Msg

    # Init a dialog agent
    alice = DialogAgent(
        name="Alice",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Alice.",
    )

    # Send a message to the agent
    msg = Msg("Bob", "Hi! What's your name?", "user")
    response = alice(msg)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Alice: Hello, Bob! My name is Alice. It's nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-82

UserAgent
----------------------------
The `UserAgent` class allows users to interact with the other agents.
When the `UserAgent` object is called, it will ask for user input and format
it into a `Msg` object.

Here we show how to initialize a `UserAgent` object and interact with the
dialog agent `alice`.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-98

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import UserAgent
    from io import StringIO
    import sys

    user = UserAgent(
        name="Bob",
        input_hint="User input: \n",
    )

    # Simulate user input
    sys.stdin = StringIO("Do you know me?\n")

    msg = user()
    msg = alice(msg)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    User input: 
    Bob: Do you know me?
    Alice: Hello Bob! I don't have any specific information about you beyond what you've shared in our conversation. I'm here to help with any questions or tasks you might have. Is there something in particular you'd like to chat about or get help with?




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 99-106

DictDialogAgent
----------------------------
The `DictDialogAgent` supports structured output and automatic post-processing by specifying its parser via the `set_parser` method.


We first initialize a `DictDialogAgent` object, and switch between different outputs by changing the parser.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 106-134

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import DictDialogAgent
    from agentscope.parsers import MarkdownJsonDictParser


    charles = DictDialogAgent(
        name="Charles",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Charles.",
        max_retries=3,  # The maximum number of retries when failing to get a required structured output
    )

    # Ask the agent to generate structured output with `thought`, `speak`, and `decision`
    parser1 = MarkdownJsonDictParser(
        content_hint={
            "thought": "what your thought",
            "speak": "what you speak",
            "decision": "your final decision, true/false",
        },
        required_keys=["thought", "speak", "decision"],
    )

    charles.set_parser(parser1)
    msg1 = charles(Msg("Bob", "Is it a good idea to go out in the rain?", "user"))

    print(f"The content field: {msg1.content}")
    print(f"The type of content field: {type(msg1.content)}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Charles: ```json
    {"thought": "Going out in the rain can be refreshing, but it depends on the temperature and if Bob has the right gear to stay dry and warm. I should consider these factors before giving advice.", "speak": "It can be nice to go out in the rain, especially if you have a good umbrella or raincoat. Do you have the right gear to stay dry?", "decision": false}
    ```
    The content field: {'thought': 'Going out in the rain can be refreshing, but it depends on the temperature and if Bob has the right gear to stay dry and warm. I should consider these factors before giving advice.', 'speak': 'It can be nice to go out in the rain, especially if you have a good umbrella or raincoat. Do you have the right gear to stay dry?', 'decision': False}
    The type of content field: <class 'dict'>




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 135-136

Then, we ask the agent to pick a number from 1 to 10.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 136-150

.. code-block:: Python


    parser2 = MarkdownJsonDictParser(
        content_hint={
            "thought": "what your thought",
            "speak": "what you speak",
            "number": "the number you choose",
        },
    )

    charles.set_parser(parser2)
    msg2 = charles(Msg("Bob", "Pick a number from 1 to 10.", "user"))

    print(f"The content of the response message: {msg2.content}")

 .. code-block:: none

    Charles: ```json
    {"thought": "Bob might be looking for a random number or could be playing a game. I'll pick a number and see how he responds.", "speak": "Sure, I'll pick a number. How about 7?", "number": "7"}
    ```
    The content of the response message: {'thought': "Bob might be looking for a random number or could be playing a game. I'll pick a number and see how he responds.", 'speak': "Sure, I'll pick a number. How about 7?", 'number': '7'}




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 151-155

The next question is how to post-process the structured output.
For example, the `thought` field should be stored in memory without being exposed to the others,
while the `speak` field should be displayed to the user, and the `decision` field should be easily accessible in the response message object.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 155-179

.. code-block:: Python


    parser3 = MarkdownJsonDictParser(
        content_hint={
            "thought": "what your thought",
            "speak": "what you speak",
            "number": "The number you choose",
        },
        required_keys=["thought", "speak", "number"],
        keys_to_memory=["thought", "speak", "number"],  # to be stored in memory
        keys_to_content="speak",  # to be displayed
        keys_to_metadata="number",  # to be stored in metadata field of the response message
    )

    charles.set_parser(parser3)

    msg3 = charles(Msg("Bob", "Pick a number from 20 to 30.", "user"))

    print(f"The content field: {msg3.content}")
    print(f"The type of content field: {type(msg3.content)}\n")

    print(f"The metadata field: {msg3.metadata}")
    print(f"The type of metadata field: {type(msg3.metadata)}")






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Charles: ```json
    {"thought": "Bob is asking for a number within a specific range again, possibly for a game or just to make a decision. I'll pick a number and see what he says next.", "speak": "Alright, let's go with 23. Is this for a particular reason?", "number": "23"}
    ```
    The content field: Alright, let's go with 23. Is this for a particular reason?
    The type of content field: <class 'str'>

    The metadata field: 23
    The type of metadata field: <class 'str'>

ReActAgent
----------------------------
The `ReActAgent` uses tools to solve the given problem in a reasoning-acting
loop manner.

First we prepare a tool function for the agent.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 189-202

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.service import ServiceToolkit, execute_python_code


    toolkit = ServiceToolkit()
    # Set execute_python_code as a tool by specifying partial arguments
    toolkit.add(
        execute_python_code,
        timeout=300,
        use_docker=False,
        maximum_memory_bytes=None,
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 203-205

Then we initialize a `ReActAgent` to solve the given problem.

    david = ReActAgent(
        name="David",

        service_toolkit=toolkit,
