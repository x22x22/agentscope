DialogAgent
----------------------------
The dialog agent is the most basic agent in AgentScope, which can interact
with users in a dialog manner.
Developers can customize it by providing different system prompts and model
configurations.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-72

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import DialogAgent
    from agentscope.message import Msg

    # Init a dialog agent
    alice = DialogAgent(
        name="Alice",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Alice.",
    )

    # Send a message to the agent
    msg = Msg("Bob", "Hi! What's your name?", "user")
    response = alice(msg)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Alice: Hello, Bob! My name is Alice. It's nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-82

UserAgent
----------------------------
The `UserAgent` class allows users to interact with the other agents.
When the `UserAgent` object is called, it will ask for user input and format
it into a `Msg` object.

Here we show how to initialize a `UserAgent` object and interact with the
dialog agent `alice`.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-98

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import UserAgent
    from io import StringIO
    import sys

    user = UserAgent(
        name="Bob",
        input_hint="User input: \n",
    )

    # Simulate user input
    sys.stdin = StringIO("Do you know me?\n")

    msg = user()
    msg = alice(msg)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    User input: 
    Bob: Do you know me?
    Alice: Hi Bob! I don't have any specific information about you, as I'm designed to respect user privacy. I just remember the name you mentioned in our conversation. How can I help you today?




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 99-106

DictDialogAgent
----------------------------
The `DictDialogAgent` supports structured output and automatic post-processing by specifying its parser via the `set_parser` method.


We first initialize a `DictDialogAgent` object, and switch between different outputs by changing the parser.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 106-135

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import DictDialogAgent
    from agentscope.parsers import MarkdownJsonDictParser


    charles = DictDialogAgent(
        name="Charles",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Charles.",
        max_retries=3,  # The maximum number of retries when failing to get a required structured output
    )

    # Ask the agent to generate structured output with `thought`, `speak`, and `decision`
    parser1 = MarkdownJsonDictParser(
        content_hint={
            "thought": "what your thought",
            "speak": "what you speak",
            "decision": "your final decision, true/false",
        },
        keys_to_metadata="decision",
        required_keys=["thought", "speak", "decision"],
    )

    charles.set_parser(parser1)
    msg1 = charles(Msg("Bob", "Is it a good idea to go out in the rain?", "user"))

    print(f"The metadata field: {msg1.metadata}")
    print(f"The type of metadata field: {type(msg1.metadata)}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Charles: ```json
    {"thought": "Going out in the rain can be refreshing and fun, but it also depends on the reason for going out and if one is prepared with proper gear like an umbrella or raincoat.", "speak": "It can be nice to go out in the rain, especially if you have the right gear. Do you have a specific reason for wanting to go out, or are you just thinking about enjoying the weather?", "decision": false}
    ```
    The metadata field: False
    The type of metadata field: <class 'bool'>




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 136-137

Then, we ask the agent to pick a number from 1 to 10.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 137-154

.. code-block:: Python


    parser2 = MarkdownJsonDictParser(
        content_hint={
            "thought": "what your thought",
            "speak": "what you speak",
            "number": "the number you choose",
        },
        keys_to_metadata="number",
        keys_to_content="speak",
    )

    charles.set_parser(parser2)
    msg2 = charles(Msg("Bob", "Pick a number from 1 to 10.", "user"))

    print(f"The content of the response message: {msg2.content}")
    print(f"The metadata of the response message: {msg2.metadata}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Charles: ```json
    {"thought": "Bob might be playing a guessing game or just looking for a random number. I'll pick a number between 1 and 10.", "speak": "Sure, I'll pick a number. How about 7?", "number": "7"}
    ```
    The content of the response message: Sure, I'll pick a number. How about 7?
    The metadata of the response message: 7




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 155-159

The next question is how to post-process the structured output.
For example, the `thought` field should be stored in memory without being exposed to the others,
while the `speak` field should be displayed to the user, and the `decision` field should be easily accessible in the response message object.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 159-183

.. code-block:: Python


    parser3 = MarkdownJsonDictParser(
        content_hint={
            "thought": "what your thought",
            "speak": "what you speak",
            "number": "The number you choose",
        },
        required_keys=["thought", "speak", "number"],
        keys_to_memory=["thought", "speak", "number"],  # to be stored in memory
        keys_to_content="speak",  # to be displayed
        keys_to_metadata="number",  # to be stored in metadata field of the response message
    )

    charles.set_parser(parser3)

    msg3 = charles(Msg("Bob", "Pick a number from 20 to 30.", "user"))

    print(f"The content field: {msg3.content}")
    print(f"The type of content field: {type(msg3.content)}\n")

    print(f"The metadata field: {msg3.metadata}")
    print(f"The type of metadata field: {type(msg3.metadata)}")






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Charles: ```json
    {"thought": "Bob is asking for a number within a specific range, likely for a game or just out of curiosity. I'll pick a number between 20 and 30.", "speak": "Alright, I'll choose a number between 20 and 30. Let's go with 25.", "number": "25"}
    ```
    The content field: Alright, I'll choose a number between 20 and 30. Let's go with 25.
    The type of content field: <class 'str'>

    The metadata field: 25
    The type of metadata field: <class 'str'>

ReActAgent
----------------------------
The `ReActAgent` uses tools to solve the given problem in a reasoning-acting
loop manner.

First we prepare a tool function for the agent.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 193-206

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.service import ServiceToolkit, execute_python_code


    toolkit = ServiceToolkit()
    # Set execute_python_code as a tool by specifying partial arguments
    toolkit.add(
        execute_python_code,
        timeout=300,
        use_docker=False,
        maximum_memory_bytes=None,
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 207-209

Then we initialize a `ReActAgent` to solve the given problem.

    david = ReActAgent(
