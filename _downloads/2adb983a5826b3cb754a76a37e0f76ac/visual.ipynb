It provides the following features:\n\n* **Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface, where you can monitor your running applications, and look through the running histories.\n\n* **Workstation**: A powerful interface to build your multi-agent applications with Dragging & Dropping.\n\n* **Server Manager**: An easy-to-use monitoring and management tool for managing large-scale distributed applications.\n\n* **Gallery**: Fruitful applications and demos in Workstation. (Coming soon!)\n\nFor details about Workstation and Gallery, please refer to `Low-code\nDevelopments <low-code>`.\nFor details about Server Manager, please refer to `Distribution\n<distribution>`.\n\n\n\n### Start AgentScope Studio\n\nTo start a studio, first ensure you have installed the latest version of\nAgentScope. Then, you can simply run the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport agentscope\nagentscope.studio.init()\n```\nOr you can run the following command in the terminal:\n\n.. code-block :: python\n\n    as_studio\n\nAfter that, you can visit AgentScope studio at http://127.0.0.1:5000, and\nthe following page will be displayed:\n\n<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01Xic0GQ1ZkJ4M0iD8F_!!6000000003232-0-tps-3452-1610.jpg\" align=\"center\" class=\"bordered-image\">\n\nOf course, you can change the host and port, and link to your application\nrunning histories by providing the following arguments:\n\n```python\nimport agentscope\n\nagentscope.studio.init(\n    host=\"127.0.0.1\",          # The IP address of AgentScope studio\n    port=5000,                 # The port number of AgentScope studio\n    run_dirs = [               # The directories of your running histories\n        \"xxx/xxx/runs\",\n        \"xxx/xxx/runs\"\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Dashboard\n\nDashboard is a web interface to monitor your running applications and look\nthrough the running histories.\n\n\n#### Note\n\nCurrently, Dashboard has the following limitations, and we are working on\nimproving it. Any feedback, contribution, or suggestion are welcome!\n\n* The running application and AgentScope Studio must be running on the same\nmachine for ``URL/path consistency``. If you want to visit AgentScope in the\nother machine, you can try to forward the port to the remote machine by\nrunning the following command in the remote machine:\n\n.. code-block :: bash\n\n    # Supposing AgentScope is running on {as_host}:{as_port}, and the port\n    # of the remote machine is {remote_machine_port}\n    ssh -L {remote_machine_port}:{as_host}:{as_port} [{user_name}@]{as_host}\n\n* For distributed applications, the single-machine & multiprocess mode is\nsupported, but the multi-machine multiprocess mode is not supported yet.\n\n#### Register Running Application\n\nAfter starting the AgentScope Studio, you can register your running\napplications by specifying ``studio_url`` in ``agentscope.init()``:\n\n```python\nimport agentscope\n\nagentscope.init(\n    # ...\n    project=\"xxx\",\n    name=\"xxx\",\n    studio_url=\"http://127.0.0.1:5000\"    # The URL of AgentScope Studio\n)\n```\nAfter registering, you can view the running application in the Dashboard. To\ndistinguish different applications, you can specify the project and name of\nthe application.\n\n<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01zcUmuJ1I3OUXy1Q35_!!6000000000837-0-tps-3426-1718.jpg\" align=\"center\" class=\"bordered-image\">\n\nClick the program with status ``waiting`` to enter the execution\ninterface. For example, the following picture show a conversation interface.\n\n<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01sA3VUc1h7OLKVLfr3_!!6000000004230-0-tps-3448-1736.jpg\" align=\"center\" class=\"bordered-image\">\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Once you register the running application, the input operation</p></div>\n within the ``agentscope.agents.UserAgent`` class will be transferred to the\n Dashboard in AgentScope Studio, and you can enter the input in the Dashboard.\n\n#### Import Running Histories\n\nIn AgentScope, the running histories are saved in the ``./runs directory`` by\ndefault. If you want to watch these running histories in the Dashboard, you\ncan specify the ``run_dirs`` in ``agentscope.studio.init()``:\n\n\n```python\nimport agentscope\n\nagentscope.studio.init(\n    run_dirs = [\"xxx/runs\"]\n)\n```\n"
